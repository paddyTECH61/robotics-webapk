										<h2 class="major">Why Are Humanoid Robots Gaining Popularity?</h2>
										<p>Humanoid robots integrating artificial intelligence (AI) have been making headlines across various media platforms, generating significant buzz. Major corporations such as Samsung, LG, and Tesla are actively investing in the robotics industry, accelerating market expansion.
                                           One key reason for the growing attention toward humanoid robots is their ability to efficiently complement or replace human labor while requiring minimal modifications to existing work environments.
                                            As societies face accelerating aging populations, the demand for automation technologies and robotic solutions to supplement the workforce is rising, prompting more companies to enter this market.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Blue Collar Jobs</h2>
										<p>AI is already seen as a threat to many white-collar jobs, but soon, AI may play a part in replacing some blue-collar jobs. How soon will an AI robot show up at your house to fix your plumbing?
                                           AI-enhanced robots are the next wave of AI on the technological horizon. Until now, AI has most often been associated with software, particularly computer-based chatbots that answer our questions. Agentic AI has also surfaced, in which AI applications—agents--make decisions and perform tasks with minimal human oversight</p>
